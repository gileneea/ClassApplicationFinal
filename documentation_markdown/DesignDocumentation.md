## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an automated licensing API which has the ability to read in a file of licenses. In addition to this it can check in, initialize, and shutdown licensing as needed. See README.md for list of requirements and time estimation.

## Functionality
The licensing library uses the library API which reads in the text file in order to perform functions on the licenses such as checking in and out licenses.
